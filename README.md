# mysql-sysbench-test
auto install mysql5.6 and sysbench mysqlnewinstall.sh
test shell jointest.sh, look into it after you begin the test;
you need to setup configuration to it;
it will use sysbench.sh and cleantest.sh;
check sysbench then you will know what to setup in jointest.sh;
you can use my.cnf in different dirs;
logs are form different tests;
webset2for2G websetfor4G have good result at least at my point of view;
if the test have some problem and cannot fix, reinstall the mysql with reinstall.sh;
